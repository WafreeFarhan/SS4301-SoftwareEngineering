This is a studentportal program where you can check your student detail & module timetable.
- For the before, the code was in a mess of if-statements & elif-statements thats centered into one big operation, which makes the whole code operation more convoluted
- Therefore, the after code splits these operation into different function so that it is more identifiable on which part of the program does what (doesnt work though due to time constraint (self-fault) & fear of further late submission)
